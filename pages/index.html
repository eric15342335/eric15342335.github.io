    <p>
      I am a third year undergraduate student at <a href="https://hku.hk">the University of Hong Kong</a>, studying <a href="https://saasweb.hku.hk/current/aai.php">Applied Artificial Intelligence</a> and <a href="https://cs.hku.hk">Computer Science</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am an open-source enthusiast. As a former member of the <a href="https://pyinstaller.org">PyInstaller</a> development team, I actively contributed hook patch requests to the <code><a href="https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller-hooks-contrib">pyinstaller-hooks-contrib</a></code> repository, collaborating with developers such as bwoodsend and rokm.

    <q>Why do I love computer science? It was never simply AI, programming, or development. It is the mindset of knowing something is happening underneath. You are surprised and you want to know why. And after you understand that at this low level, something even more happens at a much lower level and you are surprised again. I feel like this kind of stuff is really interesting.</q>
