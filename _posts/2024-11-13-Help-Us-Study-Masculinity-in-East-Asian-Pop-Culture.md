## Hello everyone`!`

We are students from [The University of Hong Kong][hku], working on a research project for the course [_CCHU9071: Man Up: Masculinities in the Making_][cchu9071-hku], exploring the phenomenon of ["Little Fresh Meat" (LFM)][little-fresh-meat-wiki] and Pan-East Asian Soft Masculinity (PEASM) in modern East Asian pop culture. We are currently conducting a survey to gather relevant insights. Your participation is very important to us.

The questionnaire will take approximately 5 minutes to complete, and all responses will remain anonymous and will be used solely for our course research.
