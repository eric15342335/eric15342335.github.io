## Background

I was amazed when I discovered these [guided projects][coursera-guided-projects] on [Coursera][coursera-platform]:

1. [Create a Profile and Network on LinkedIn][linkedin-profile-network]
2. [5 Ways to Build a Better LinkedIn Profile][linkedin-better-profile]
3. [Create a Resume and Cover Letter with Google Docs][resume-google-docs]
4. [How to Optimize Your Instagram Account][optimize-instagram]
5. [Introduction to Google Docs][intro-google-docs]
6. [Small Business Marketing Using Facebook][facebook-marketing]
7. [Small Business Marketing Using YouTube][youtube-marketing]

And the list goes beyond here.

Sure, these topics seem too easy, especially since we are living in such an age that these kinds of Internet skills can be picked up relatively quickly by teenagers ([Gen Z][gen-z], [Gen Alpha][gen-alpha], for example).

I am quite certain that many of the people in my current age somehow learned all the above skills by solely relying on themselves and experimenting with those features. I still remember one of my friends knowing how to open a [WhatsApp business][whatsapp-business] account when he was studying secondary school for the 4th year.

### Why guided projects matter

But I quickly realized that even in this [Internet age][internet-age], there are still a lot of people who don't know how to use certain apps or software.

I don't know if it was your case, but apparently some of my relatives (even younger ones) still do not have experience with [Google Docs][google-docs], for example. Some of them even have basic computer skills (like [opening and copying files from a USB][open-files-from-usb-and-copy]), but they do not get beyond that level.

Not to mention that guided projects are designed to be finished rather quickly, [under 2 hours][coursera-guided-projects-2hr-googleSearch]. From [my experience][my-linkedin-license&certs], it's like attending a regular university lecture but in a more fun and stress-free environment. Plus, you get a [certificate after completion][intro-google-docs-cert]! It certainly explores my curiosity into learning things after I was deeply defeated by [the (very) lengthy courses][intro-to-machine-learning] on Coursera.

### Conclusion

If you don't know which courses to start due to their expected completion time, maybe [Coursera guided projects][coursera-guided-projects] are a good start for you.

#### Disclaimer

This is not an advertisement of Coursera guided projects. Just my personal reflection, as [my university got Coursera licenses][hku-coursera-license].
