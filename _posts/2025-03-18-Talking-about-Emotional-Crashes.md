## Preliminary

When we talk about emotional crashes, some people may have experienced them before, while some may not. Some people may have crashed but aren’t aware of it. Some are even suspicious of themselves, thinking they "will have" or "are going to" crash "very soon." Emotional crashes are an ongoing topic for discussion, primarily due to their overwhelming impact on a typical (university) student. Therefore, many people realize it’s important to address what an emotional crash is, what the signs of an impending crash are, and how to avoid or face it. This short blog post aims to cover information about emotional crashes extensively, in the hope that most readers can benefit from understanding them.

## What is an Emotional Crash

Most people might have a sense that not working on something or being productive for several days (or even a week or two) is an emotional crash. I believe mostly those are consequences of not having a regular, consistent life (study) schedule, or the influence from your environment. To be fair, I’m not saying those aren’t "crashes," but I believe the "emotional crash" I’m talking about here may have a different definition from what you’ve learned previously. For me, an emotional crash is a short moment where an enormous amount of negative emotions explodes upon your head, making you feel extremely uncomfortable with what you’re currently doing, wanting to stop every task you’ve assigned to yourself, and being unproductive.

## When Will You Crash

It’s not something we can confidently forecast. But sometimes, having a 4-hour consecutive lecture might increase the risk of an emotional disaster. Insufficient sleep might also come into play.

## Am I Really Crashing?

"Crashes" are subjective. It’s hard to have a generalized rule that applies to everyone. But usually, when you’re crashing, you prioritize short-term benefits over long-term rewards. You actively seek entertainment activities or refuse to do anything productive. (Doomscrolling usually happens after this, though doomscrolling can be a cause of a crash too.)

## Some Important Facts About Emotional Crashes

1. Emotional burst. Ineffective to manage (lost the ability to do so).  
2. Walking zombie.

## What You Really Need to Do When There Is a Crash

1. Take a deep breath. Start walking around. According to my own experience, walking inside HKU from CYM Canteen to Centennial Campus for 2-3 times is beneficial to your mental wellbeing, physical health, and understanding of life.  
2. Do not dodge your challenges/tasks immediately. Instead, (while you’re walking) slow down your thinking for a moment.  
3. You might want to negotiate with yourself: how much entertainment do you really want? Perhaps a short 30-minute break would suffice, instead of spending the upcoming 4 hours on some leisure activity.

## What Should You Do When Others Crash

It’s common to see others suddenly cancelling tasks or events that might have previously meant a lot to them. It’s quite normal for people who are experiencing an emotional downhill or "crash." You shouldn’t really be glad of this (though no need to feel guilty if you’re an introvert like me—I’d feel happy when someone cancels an appointment with me, unless it’s a study meeting!), because when you see their message, it usually reflects a (deep) trust built upon you (that’s why you’re seeing it).

### Don’t

1. Ignore the message.  
2. Say "Okay." and go away.  
3. Send "Hope you will get well soon!" (It’s more like a harmless but unhelpful message that’s too generic to be considered useful.)

### Do’s

1. If you have an understanding of their recent activities, that’s a good sign! Relate their message to what they recently posted on social media (like having an exam, revising for a quiz, etc.). You might be able to build an understanding of why they said it this way.  
2. Realize what they really need. This is hard. You might use this clue: Focus on what events/tasks they have cancelled yet. If they need your help on that task, simply saying "Whenever you need me, just give me a call" would significantly boost your mental intelligence.

## How to Sense Others Having a Crash

I think this is easy, given that you have an understanding of the person. The difficult part comes from overcoming your ignorance towards the crash and actually putting yourself into the context of what others need at the beginning of your logic flow.

## Final Notes

Life is not easy. It’s multifaceted and full of variety. We almost surely won’t walk the same path on our life journey, whether it’s the course enrollment order, skills learning priorities, or any other experiences and knowledge. But it’s important to consider that no one is not unique.

Hope this helps!

## Recent Updates

I’m having some major mid-terms in the upcoming weeks. It’s very important for me to keep a consistent study/sleeping schedule from now on.  
Some gibberish:  

* I got an offer from RTHK for a summer internship. This somewhat makes me feel secure about my Year 2 summer internship period, despite it only being 2 months.  
* The vast amount of knowledge I’ve been exposed to recently (over the past few months) is worrying. I believe I won’t be able to memorize every detail and word from the lecture notes, despite examinations possibly testing them.  
* A pattern I’ve noticed: for some subjects (e.g., database/SQL), it’s quite difficult for me to forget the knowledge (e.g., how to write MySQL queries). But for some courses like STAT3600 Linear Statistical Analysis (severe), APAI3010 Computer Vision (mild), and web development (mild), I don’t understand why I forget stuff so quickly (like within several days or weeks). I believe this is due to a lack of practice (of the key concepts via exercises).  
* I don’t really recommend people take 6 courses per semester… It’s somewhat a mental stress test. Doing that is only good if you’ve already mastered at least 50% of the content for, like, 3 courses. Disclaimer: The numbers might not apply to everyone, depending on their study patterns and intelligence/perseverance.

## Some interesting information if you want to know about me

* I’m ISTP-T. If you’ve finished an MBTI test before, you’ll know what it means.  
* I have no dating experience (why would someone ask me this?).
